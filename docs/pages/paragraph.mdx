      Once upon a time, there was a React component named SelfTest. SelfTest was
      special because it had the ability to test itself. Every time the
      component rendered, it would run a series of tests to ensure that it was
      working properly. The tests were thorough and covered all of the
      component's functionality. SelfTest was proud of its ability to test
      itself and never failed a single test.
